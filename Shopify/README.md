# Shopify App Analysis

This project analyzes data from the Shopify App Store to identify key factors influencing app success. The analysis was conducted using Power BI.

## Project Description

The project involves reviewing the landscape of apps on the Shopify platform using publicly available data. The goal is to determine what factors contribute to the success of a Shopify app. The analysis is structured into four parts, each focusing on a different aspect of the data:

1.  **App Landscape:** Key statistics on app types.
2.  **Reviews:** Analysis of app reviews and helpfulness.
3.  **App Reviews:** Relationship between apps and reviews, developer responsiveness.
4.  **Submission:** Project submission requirements (screenshots).

## Data

The analysis uses the `shopify.xlsx` dataset, which contains four tables:

* `apps`: Details of apps on the Shopify App Marketplace.
* `apps_categories`: Join table connecting apps and categories.
* `categories`: Categories of the apps.
* `reviews`: User opinions about apps (rating, comment) and developer replies.

## Tools Used

* Power BI

## Project Structure

The Power BI project is organized into four pages, corresponding to the four parts of the analysis:

* App Landscape
* Reviews
* App Reviews

## Key Analyses

* KPI Card for unique app count.
* Line chart of review count over time.
* Scatterplot of review count vs. average rating.
* DAX calculations for `helpful_reviews` and `developer_answered`.
* Analysis of developer responsiveness and app ratings.

## Submission

The project was submitted as a series of 8 screenshots, two from each of the four Power BI report pages.
