# Zomato Restaurant Analysis Project

This project was completed as part of a Business Intelligence Analyst program with Zomato, a multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. The goal was to analyze restaurant data to provide insights into business performance.

## Project Description

As a junior analyst, I was tasked with analyzing Zomato's data focusing on one of the following areas:

* Customer Analysis
* Restaurant Analysis
* Sales Analysis

I chose to focus on **Restaurant Analysis**. The project involved:

1.  **Decomposition (Planning):** Creating a detailed research plan, defining key questions, and outlining the intended dashboard visualizations.
2.  **Analysis and Dashboard Creation:** Executing the research plan, developing a dashboard using Power BI, and compiling a report with key findings and recommendations.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several important insights:

* Restaurant popularity is not solely determined by cuisine type.
* There is a nuanced relationship between restaurant ratings and the number of reviews. Restaurants with higher review counts tend to have slightly lower average ratings.
* High sales do not always translate to high revenue.
* North Indian and Chinese cuisines are significant contributors to revenue and have high review volumes'.

## Recommendations

* Restaurants should actively encourage customers to provide reviews to better understand and improve customer satisfaction.

## Technologies Used

* Power BI
* Zomato Dataset (provided)

## Data Sources

The project utilized the Zomato data.zip archive, which includes the following tables:

* food
* menu
